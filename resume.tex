    \section{\mysidestyle Education}

    \textbf{Vanderbilt University}, Nashville, TN \vspace{2mm}\\\vspace{1mm}%
    \textsl{M.S., Materials Science} \hfill \textbf{Aug 2016 -- Dec 2019 (Expected)}\\
   Continued computational chemistry research and became one of the lead developers on a set of open-source Python libraries designed to provide a simulation engine-agnostic platform to initialize chemical systems of interest in a document-able, reproducible fashion (\url{https://mosdef.org}). Completed course-work in scientific computing, condensed matter physics, and advanced scientific computing.


    \textbf{Clemson University}, Clemson, SC \vspace{2mm}\\\vspace{1mm}%
    \textsl{B.S., Materials Science and Chemistry Minor} \hfill \textbf{Aug 2012 -- May 2016}\\
    Participated in computational chemistry research for 3 semesters, developing helper tools for the lab in Python to detect and enumerate alkane molecules of various lengths from high temperature reactive forcefield molecular dynamics simulations.
    % Commented out for now, not applicable for data-science or software-dev
    % Received certification as a Certified SOLIDWORKS Associate (CSWA), and was historian for 1 year of the Phi Psi honors fraternity
    Completed course-work in multi-variable calculus, differential equations, data structures and algorithms, software development, and physical chemistry.

    
    \section{\mysidestyle Professional\\Experience}

    \textbf{Vanderbilt Univeristy}, Nashville, TN \vspace{2mm}\\\vspace{1mm}%
    \textsl{Graduate Research Assistant} \hfill \textbf{Aug 2016 -- Present}\\
    Conducted various computational studies of organic chemistry-based compounds using molecular modeling as well as open-source Python software development. Notable work includes:

    \begin{itemize}[itemsep=0.5mm, parsep=2pt]
    \item Designed and implemented an extensible ``plug-in'' system for our chemical system building library \pkg{mBuild} allowing for dynamic discovery of plug-ins through the use of the \pkg{setuptools} \pkg{entrypoint} functionality.
    \item Continued development of our lab's Python libraries by using software development best practices such as unit testing, collaborative code review, continuous integration, object-oriented design patterns, fork and pull request model for code contributions, and input sanitization 
    \item Became one of the lead software developers of the lab's open-source Python libraries \url{https://github.com/mosdef-hub}, now involved in a national grant involving 7 other universities.
    \item Managed and instructed the simulation of over \num{36000} chemical systems, performed time-series and statistical analysis of data from these systems to use partly as testing/training data of a random forest regression model from \pkg{sklearn}, producing a predictive model linking chemical features to tribological properties.
    \item Mentored undergraduate and high school students year-round in molecular simulation, data analysis, and scientific software development best practices.
      %Taught version control, software development using Python, data analysis, and interacting with the UNIX shell.
      %Aided students in all aspects of molecular simulation, including award winning poster presentations.
    \end{itemize}


    \textbf{Vanderbilt Univeristy}, Nashville, TN \vspace{2mm}\\\vspace{1mm}%
    \textsl{Graduate Teaching Assistant} \hfill \textbf{Aug 2016 -- Dec 2019}\\
    Developed course-work and lecture material for a 3\textsuperscript{rd} year molecular simulation course as well as a 1\textsuperscript{st} year engineering computation course.
    Created lessons utilizing Jupyter Notebooks, GitHub Classroom, teaching version control and Python to students with little to no experience of programming concepts.
    %Also performed teaching-assistant duties for a 3\textsuperscript{rd} year mechanical engineering lab, as well as an additional 1\textsuperscript{st} year engineering course.

    \textbf{Clemson Univeristy}, Clemson, SC \vspace{2mm}\\\vspace{1mm}%
    \textsl{Tutor} \hfill \textbf{Aug 2013 -- May 2016}\\
    Provided academic tutoring to 500 first year science and engineering students as part of the Residents in Science and Engineering (RiSE) Living-Learning Community (LLC) (\url{https://1n.pm/rise}).
    %Led general chemistry study sessions for exam preparation.
    %Mentored minority students through a program offered by the RiSE LLC.
